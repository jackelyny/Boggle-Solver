# Boggle-Solver

A boggle is a word game played on a 4x4 grid of letters. You play by selecting a letter and forming words by traversing to any adjacent letters (up, down, left, right or any of the 4 diagonal directions when available). 

Rules:
1. You cannot go outside the board.
2. You cannot traverse to a letter more than once. 

In the program that I have written, only words between 3-16 of length will be considered.

In the image above, the word 'PEACE' can be formed.
